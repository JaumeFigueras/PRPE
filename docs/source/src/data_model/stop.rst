STOP
====

In the GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification), ``stops.txt`` defines all the physical locations in
your transit system where passengers can board, alight, or interact with the system.

It is not limited to just bus stops or train platforms â€” it can also include stations, entrances,
and special boarding areas.

This class and its associated enumerations model the ``stops.txt`` file in SQLAlchemy in order to store
the data needed
